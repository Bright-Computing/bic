This directory contains the typical Unix user environment set-up
as defined through user dot files.  Each user is given
a selection of these dot-files and are customized by the
user to his wishes.  (An alternative is proposed in ../ext.)

There are system or global shell login files, but changes in them
can have disasterous results and side-effects if not fully tested.

The add.modules script can add or modify the appropriate lines at the
beginning of the dot-files to set-up the modules environment.

The user skeleton dot-files are in ./skel
The global shell login files are in ./global
