.SH NAME
modulefile \- files containing Tcl code for the Modules package
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fImodulefile\fPs are written in the Tool Command Language,
.BR Tcl (3)
and are interpreted by the
.B modulecmd
program via the
.BR module (1)
user interface.
modulefiles can be loaded, unloaded, or switched on-the-fly while the user is working; and can
be used to implement site policies regarding the access and use of applications.
.LP
A \fImodulefile\fP begins with the magic cookie, '#%Module'.
A version number may be placed after this string.
The version number is useful as the \fImodulefile\fP format may change.
If a version number doesn't exist, then
.B modulecmd
will assume the \fImodulefile\fP is compatible with the latest version.
The current \fImodulefile version\fP is
.B 1.0.
Files without the magic cookie will not be interpreted by
.B modulecmd.
.LP
Each \fImodulefile\fP contains the changes to a user's environment needed
to access an application.
Tcl is a simple programming language which permits modulefiles to be
arbitrarily complex, depending upon the application's and the modulefile
writer's needs.
If support for extended tcl (tclX) has been configured for your installation of
the Modules package, you may use all the extended commands provided by tclX, too.
.LP
A typical \fImodulefile\fP is a simple bit of code that set or add entries to
the PATH, MANPATH, or other environment variables.
Tcl has conditional statements that are evaluated when the modulefile
is loaded.
This is very effective for managing path or environment changes due to different
OS releases or architectures.
The user environment information is encapsulated into a single \fImodulefile\fP
kept in a central location.
The same modulefile is used by every user on any machine.
So, from the user's perspective, starting an application is exactly the same
irrespective of the machine or platform they are on.
.LP
modulefiles also hide the notion of different types of shells.
From the user's perspective, changing the environment for one shell looks exactly
the same as changing the environment for another shell.
This is useful for new or novice users and eliminates the need for statements such
as "if you're using the C Shell do this ..., otherwise if you're using the Bourne
shell do this ..."
Announcing and accessing new software is uniform and independent of the user's shell.
From the modulefile writer's perspective, this means one set of information
will take care of every type of shell.
.LP
.SH Modules Specific Tcl Commands
The Modules Package uses commands which are extensions to the "standard"
.I Tool Command Language
.BR Tcl (3)
package.
Unless otherwise specified, the Module commands return the empty string.
Some commands behave differently when a \fImodulefile\fP is loaded or
unloaded.
The command descriptions assume the \fImodulefile\fP is being loaded.
.PP
.B break
.RS
This is not a Modules-specific command, it's actually part of Tcl,
which has been overloaded similar to the
.I continue
and
.I exit
commands to have the 
effect of causing the module not to be listed
as loaded and not affect other modules being loaded concurrently.
All non-environment commands within the module will be performed
up to this point and processing will continue on to the
next module on the command line.
The
.I break
command will only have this effect if not used within a Tcl loop though.

An example: Suppose that a full selection of modulefiles are needed
for various different architectures, but some of the modulefiles
are not needed and the user should be alerted.  Having the unnecessary
modulefile be a link to the following
.I notavail
modulefile will perform the task as required.
.nf

proc ModulesHelp { } {
    puts stderr	"\tThis module does nothing but alert the user"
    puts stderr	"\tthat the [module-info name] module is not available"
}

module-whatis	"Notifies user that module is not available."
set curMod [module-info name]

    puts stderr	"Note: '$curMod' is not available for [uname sysname]."
}

.RE

.PP
.B chdir
.I directory
.RS
Set the current working directory to \fIdirectory\fP.
.RE

.PP
.B continue
.RS
This is not a modules specific command but another overloaded Tcl
command
and is similar to the
.I break
or
.I exit
commands
except the module will be listed as loaded as well as performing
any environment or Tcl commands up to this point
and then continuing on to the next module on the command line.
The
.I continue
command will only have this effect if not used within a Tcl loop though.
.RE

.PP
.B exit [N]
.RS
This is not a modules specific command but another overloaded Tcl
command
and is similar to the
.I break
or
.I continue
commands.
However, this command will cause the immediate cessation
of this module and any additional ones on the command line.
This module and the subsequent modules will not be listed 
as loaded.  No environment commands will be performed in
the current module.

The integer value
.I N
after the
.I exit
command will be used as an command exit value; however, some shells
.RI ( bash
being one of them)
do not carry this value through an
.I eval
though. For
.I bash
and those Bourne shells
.RI ( /bin/sh )
being emulated by the
.I bash
will have return a non-zero value as a result of
.I test 0 = 1
being appended to the evaluate string.
.RE

.PP
.B setenv
.I variable
.I value
.RS
Set environment \fIvariable\fP to \fIvalue\fP.
The \fBsetenv\fP command will also change the process' environment.
A reference using Tcl's \fBenv\fP associative array will reference changes
made with the \fBsetenv\fP command.
Changes made using Tcl's \fBenv\fP associative array will \fBNOT\fP
change the user's environment variable like the \fBsetenv\fP command.
An environment change made this way will only affect the
module parsing process.
The \fBsetenv\fP command is also useful for changing the environment prior
to the \fBexec\fP or \fBsystem\fP command.
When a \fImodulefile\fP is unloaded, \fBsetenv\fP becomes \fBunsetenv\fP.
If the environment variable had been defined it will be overwritten while
loading the modulefile.  A subsequent unload will unset the environment
variable - the previous value cannot be restored!  (Unless you handle
it explicitly ... see below.)
.RE
.PP
.B unsetenv
.I variable
.RI [ value ]
.RS
Unsets environment \fIvariable\fP.
However, if there is an optional \fIvalue\fP, then when unloading
a module, it will set \fIvariable\fP to \fIvalue\fP.
The \fBunsetenv\fP command changes the process' environment like
\fBsetenv\fP.

.I variable
.I value
.RS
Append or prepend \fIvalue\fP to environment \fIvariable\fP.
The \fIvariable\fP is a colon, or delimiter, separated list
such as
.br
"PATH=directory:directory:directory".
The default delimiter is a colon ':', but an arbitrary one can be
given by the
.I --delim
option.
For example a space can be used instead
(which will need to be handled in the Tcl
specially by enclosing it in " " or { }).
A space, however, can not be specified by the 
.I --delim=C
form.

If the \fIvariable\fP is not set, it is created.
When a \fImodulefile\fP is unloaded, \fBappend-path\fP and
\fBprepend-path\fP become \fBremove-path\fP.
.RE
.PP

Remove \fIvalue\fP from the colon, or delimiter,
separated list in \fIvariable\fP.
See
.I prepend-path
or
.I append-path
for further explanation of using an arbitrary delimiter.
Every string between colons, or delimiters,
in \fIvariable\fP is compared to \fIvalue\fP.
If the two match, \fIvalue\fP is removed from \fIvariable\fP.

.B prereq
.I modulefile
[
.I modulefile
\&.\|.\|.
]
.br
.B conflict
.I modulefile
[
.I modulefile
\&.\|.\|.
]
.RS
\fBprereq\fP and \fBconflict\fP control whether or not the \fImodulefile\fP
will be loaded.
The \fBprereq\fP command lists modulefiles which must have been
previously loaded before the current \fImodulefile\fP will be loaded.
Similarly, the \fBconflict\fP command lists modulefiles which conflict
with the current \fImodulefile\fP.
If a list contains more than one \fImodulefile\fP, then each member of the
list acts as a Boolean OR operation.
Multiple \fBprereq\fP and \fBconflict\fP commands may be used to create a 
Boolean AND operation.
If one of the requirements have not been satisfied, an error is reported
and the current \fImodulefile\fP makes no changes to the user's environment.
.LP
If an argument for \fBprereq\fP is a directory and any \fImodulefile\fP from
the directory has been loaded, then the prerequisite is met.
For example, specifying \fIX11\fP as a prereq means that any version
of \fIX11\fP, \fIX11/R4\fP or \fIX11/R5\fP, must be loaded before proceeding.
.LP
If an argument for \fBconflict\fP is a directory and any other \fImodulefile\fP
from that directory has been loaded, then a conflict will occur.
For example, specifying \fIX11\fP as a conflict will stop \fIX11/R4\fP and
\fIX11/R5\fP from being loaded at the same time.
.RE
.PP
.B is-loaded
.I modulefile
[
.I modulefile
\&.\|.\|.
]
.RS
The \fBis-loaded\fP command returns a true value if any of the listed
modulefiles has been loaded.  If a list contains more than one
\fImodulefile\fP, then each member acts as a boolean OR operation.  If an
argument for \fBis-loaded\fP is a directory and any \fImodulefile\fP from the
directory has been loaded \fBis-loaded\fP would return a true value.
.RE
.PP
.B module
[
.I sub-command
] [
.I sub-command-args
]
.RS
Contains the same sub-commands as described in the
.BR module (1)
man page in the Module Sub-Commands section.
This command permits a \fImodulefile\fP to load or remove other
modulefiles.
No checks are made to ensure that the \fImodulefile\fP does not try to
load itself.
Often it is useful to have a single \fImodulefile\fP that performs a 
number of \fBmodule load\fP commands.
For example, if every user on the system requires a basic set of
applications loaded, then a \fIcore\fP \fImodulefile\fP would contain the
necessary \fBmodule load\fP commands.
.RE
.PP
.B module-info
.I option
[
.I info-args

.RS
Provide information about the \fBmodulecmd\fP program's state.
Some of the information is specific to the internals of \fBmodulecmd\fP.
\fIoption\fP is the type of information to be provided, and \fIinfo-args\fP
are any arguments needed.
.TP
.B module-info type
.RS
Returns either "C" or "Tcl" to indicate which module command is being
executed, either the "C" version or the Tcl-only version, to allow the
modulefile writer to handle any differences between the two.
.RE
.B module-info flags
.RS
Returns the integer value of \fBmodulecmd's\fP flags state.
.RE
.B module-info mode [\fImodetype\fP]
.RS
Returns the current \fBmodulecmd's\fP mode as a string if no \fImodetype\fP is
given.
.PP
Returns 1 if \fBmodulecmd's\fP mode is \fImodetype\fP.
\fImodetype\fP can be: \fIload, remove, display, help, whatis, 
switch, switch1, switch2,\fP or \fBswitch3.\fP

.B module-info shelltype
.RS
Return the family of the shell under which \fImodulefile\fP was invoked.

The \fIlog-facility\fP parameter specifies the log destination. This may
either switch off logging for the specified \fIerror-weight\fP, direct 
log messages to a special stream or a file or specify a syslog facility
for logging. The following values are allowed:
.PP
.RS
.I stderr, stdout

is normally used for passing parameters to the invoking shell. Directing
error output to this stream might screw up the \fImodulecmd\fP integration

.B set-alias
.I alias-name
.I alias-string

Sets an alias or function with the name \fIalias-name\fP
in the user's environment to the string \fIalias-string\fP.
Arguments can be specified using the Bourne Shell style of function arguments.
If the string contains "$1", then this will become the first argument when the
alias is interpreted by the shell.
The string "$*" corresponds to all of the arguments given to the alias.
The character '$' may be escaped using the '\\' character.
.LP
For some shells, aliases are not possible and the command has no effect.
For Bourne shell derivatives, a shell function will be written (if supported) to
give the impression of an alias.

Merge resources into the \fIX11\fP resource database.
The resources are used to control look and behavior of \fIX11\fP applications.
The command will attempt to read resources from \fIfilename\fP.
If the argument isn't a valid file name, then string will be interpreted
as a resource.
If a file is found, it will be filtered through the 
.BR cpp (1)
preprocessor, just as
.BR xrdb (1)
would do.
.PP
modulefiles that use this command, should in most cases contain one or more
\fIx-resource\fP lines, each defining one \fIX11\fP resource.
Reading resources from \fIfilename\fP is much slower, due to the preprocessing.
The DISPLAY environment variable should be properly set and
the \fIX11\fP server should be accessible.
If \fBx-resource\fP can't manipulate the \fIX11\fP resource database, the

.SH Locating Modulefiles
Every directory in \s-1MODULEPATH\s0 is searched to find the \fImodulefile\fP.
A directory in \s-1MODULEPATH\s0 can have an arbitrary number of sub-directories.
If the user names a \fImodulefile\fP to be loaded which is actually a directory,
the directory is opened and a search begins for an actual \fImodulefile\fP.
First, \fBmodulecmd\fP looks for a file with the name \fI.modulerc\fP in the
directory. If this file exists, its contents will be evaluated as if it was
a module file to be loaded. You may place \fImodule-version\fP and
\fImodule-alias\fP commands inside this file. Additionally, before seeking
for \fI.modulerc\fP files in the module directory, the global \fI.modulerc\fP
file is sourced, too. If a named version \fIdefault\fP now exists for the
module file to be loaded, the assigned modulefile now will be sourced. Otherwise
the file \fI.version\fP is looked up in the directory.
If the \fI.version\fP file exists, it is opened and interpreted as Tcl code
and takes precedence over a \fI.modulerc\fP file in the same directory.
If the Tcl variable \fBModulesVersion\fP is set by the \fI.version\fP file,
\fBmodulecmd\fP will use the name as if it specifies a \fImodulefile\fP in the
directory. This will become the \fIdefault\fP module file in this case.
If \fBModulesVersion\fP is a directory, the search begins anew down that
directory. If the name does not match any files located in the current
directory, the search continues through the remaining directories in
\s-1MODULEPATH\s0.
.LP
Every \fI.version\fP  and \fI.modulerc\fP file found is Tcl interpreted.
So, changes made in these file will affect the subsequently
interpreted \fImodulefile\fP.
.LP
If no \fIdefault\fP version may be figured out, then the highest
lexicographically sorted \fImodulefile\fP under the directory
using the 'C' locale will be used.
.LP
For example, it is possible for a user to have a directory named \fIX11\fP
which simply contains a \fI.version\fP file specifying which
version of \fIX11\fP is to be loaded.
Such a file would look like:

The 'module display \fImodulefile\fP' command will detail all changes that will
be made to the environment.
After displaying all of the environment changes \fBmodulecmd\fP will call the
\fBModulesDisplay\fP subroutine.
The \fBModulesDisplay\fP subroutine is a good place to put additional descriptive
information about the \fImodulefile\fP.
