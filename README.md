Bright-Illumina collaboration

This repository holds prototype versions of Lmod, with improved and modernized `.spec` files,
whereby startup scripts sequence under `/etc/profile.d` is as generic as possible and
minimal assumptions are made against the delivery environment (ie. sysadmins retain full control of the how).
